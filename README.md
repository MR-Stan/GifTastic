## Overview
GifTastic is a dynamic web page that utilizes the user's input to create a corresponding button. When the user clicks the button an AJAX call is made to the Giphy API and a specified number of gifs are displayed. The gifs are initially static, but can be played with a single click and paused again with an additional click. This site was created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

## Future Development
- Allow the user to specify the quantity of results
- Allow the user to remove buttons
- Utilize local storage or a database so that user data is retained on refresh
- Add a variety of search filters
- Improve the style of the site
